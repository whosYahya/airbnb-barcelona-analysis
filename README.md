# 🏡 Airbnb Price and Demand Analysis

This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and modeling **Airbnb listings data** to understand the key factors that influence **price** and **demand**. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide actionable insights for hosts, potential investors, and business analysts interested in the short-term rental market.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- **Analyze** Airbnb listings to identify factors that influence pricing.
- **Explore** seasonal trends and demand fluctuations across different regions.
- **Build predictive models** to estimate listing prices.
- **Visualize** key patterns to uncover insights and drive decisions.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis
  - Price distribution by location, property type, and amenities
  - Correlation heatmaps and outlier detection

- **Demand Analysis:**
  - Booking trends by month and day
  - Geospatial analysis of listing density and popularity
  - Reviews and availability as proxies for demand

- **Price Prediction Models:**
  - Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  - Feature selection and engineering
  - Model evaluation and comparison

- **Interactive Visualizations (Optional):**
  - Built using Plotly or Tableau for dynamic insights

## 📂 Dataset

We used publicly available Airbnb datasets from sources like:
- [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Typical fields include:
- `price`, `location`, `room_type`, `number_of_reviews`, `availability_365`, `minimum_nights`, `amenities`, etc.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Plotly
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, Tableau (optional)

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

- Identified key factors driving listing prices such as location, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
- Found seasonal and weekly demand patterns, especially in tourist-heavy areas.
- Built a regression model with an R² score of ~0.85 (example) to predict listing prices.
